# A-PHP-API-TO-MINE-VALID-EMAIL-ADDRESSES
a PHP script that mines valid email addresses from a text file

This script defines a function called extract_email_from_file that takes a file path as an argument and returns an array of email addresses extracted from the file. The function uses the file_get_contents function to read the contents of the file into a string. The function then uses the preg_match_all function to extract email addresses from the string using a regular expression pattern that matches the structure of a valid email address. The extracted email addresses are stored in the $matches variable, and the function returns the first element of this variable, which is the array of email addresses.
